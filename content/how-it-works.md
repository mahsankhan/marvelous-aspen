      Azimuth offers a simple solution to handling crypto-payments for all kinds
      of merchants. Regardless of the sheer volume of cashflows, our platform is
      available for you to handle the crypto-to-fiat bridge. Just follow the
      steps and you are good to go!


      **Sign Up:** 


      The sign-up process is super easy. Just enter your credentials and you are
      good to go.


      **Verify your Account:** 


      Once the sign-up process is complete, verify your email address through
      link received on email.


      **KYC Process:** 


      Once your account is registered, fill up the KYC form, provide required
      information and documents. Make sure to upload high-quality
      pictures/scanned photos where required to ensure speedy processing from
      our end.


      **Create fiat wallet and deposit funds:**


      Once your KYC is approved you are officially a part of the premium
      community, welcome on board! You now create a fiat wallet and connect your
      credit card/bank account in order to deposit fiat currency and fund your
      fiat wallet.


      **Receive stable-coins on alt-coin wallets:**


      Once your fiat payments are loaded into your fiat wallet, you can now
      purchase stable-coins in real-time against the funds in your wallet. It is
      that simple! Stable-coins are your secure and volatility-free entry
      tickets into the crypto-world. Pegged against the values of US dollars,
      each stable-coin equals one dollar and does not fluctuate independently.
      When you obtain your stable-coins, you are ready to exchange, send or
      receive more alt-coins through your stable-coins.


      **Keep the crypto cominâ€™!**


      You are all set to go! Keep the cashflows going and your funds fulfilled.
      The wallet functionality allows you to connect multi-currency wallets. You
      can easily obtain multiple crypto-currencies with the support for hundreds
      of crypto-currencies. Easily exchange them for stable-coins. You have
      funds, we have the coins. Keep it coming!
